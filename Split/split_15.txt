This is one of my favourite things.

(Garmadon turns around and rubs his hands over his back.)

Garmadon: I look like I'm making out with two people, don’t I?

(The Ninja laugh.)

Cole: I’m impressed.

Zane: Wonderful amusement!

Lloyd: Hey, you know what? We should, uh, we should be practising... silence right now.

Jay: Sorry. It's just... when you talk, I don't wanna listen, but when he talks... I wanna listen.

Kai: I con- I agree.

Garmadon: I've always said he's weak voiced.

Lloyd: I think we're getting off point a little bit! Just a little bit?

Garmadon: See what I mean about the weak voice? (imitating Lloyd) Like, “a little bit”? That's how he talks.

Jay: Do it again?

Garmadon: (imitating Lloyd) “A little bit”.

(The Ninja laugh.)

Lloyd: Oh, that's not how I- that doesn't sound like me.

Kai: (imitating Lloyd) He sounds more like this.

(The Ninja laugh harder.)

Zane: Look what he's doing to us! We have to focus. He's turning our minds.

Lloyd: Thank you, Zane. You get it!

Zane: (beeping) My sensors indicate a fork in the road.

(The come to a split path with two signs. One reads “The Right Path (long, arduous & enlightening)” and the other reads “Shortcut (possible skeleton graveyard”.)

Nya: (reading the sign) Hmm. The right path is long and arduous and enlightening, and the left... a shortcut!

Jay: Why would they say possible? They would know, right?

Garmadon: We're taking the shortcut! Let’s roll!

Lloyd: No, no, okay, just wait. Master Wu said we should stay on the right path.

Garmadon: What?! You wanna listen to the guy who fell off the bridge, or the guy who didn't fall off the bridge?

(The Ninja shrug and Lloyd realises he won’t win this argument. They take the shortcut.)

Jay: Hey, Zane, could you record this, and then never play it back to me?

Zane: Yes!

(Jay laughs nervously.)

Kai: Um, guys?

Nya: Maybe this isn't such a great idea.

(They see huge piles of skeletons everywhere.)

Jay: This is my least favourite place I've ever been.

(They hear voices groaning in the distance.)

Kai: Did you hear that?

(The mysterious figures jump out, yelling over each other.)

Lloyd: We’re backing it out. Back out. We’re backing out. We’re backing out! Back it- continue to back out! Continue to back it out!

(The Ninja get ambushed from behind.)

Nya: What do we do?!

Kai: There’s too many of them!

Garmadon: Wait a minute. Oh my gosh, Luh-Lloyd. They look like-

(The figures reveal themselves to be the fired Generals.)

Garmadon: My former General number ones! You guys look great! Your skin has such a lovely glow. Y'all been tanning lately, or something?

Shark General: We... were fired.

Olivia: (slurps drink) Out of a volcano.

Garmadon: Ohh! Right, right, right. Yeah, but other than that you're well.

Lloyd: Uh, Garmadon? Did you fire all of these Generals out of a volcano?

Garmadon: (scoffs) No! Not all at the same time. Don't worry. These guys are like family. They love me! Right, Generals?

(The Generals laugh maniacally.)

Shark General: Oh, we’re family alright.

Ninja: Ninjaaa GO!

(The Ninja rush in to fight off the Generals.)

Lloyd: Guys, wait! We need to use our ninja powers!

Jay: What?! What can we do? We’re worthless without our mechs!

Lloyd: Come on! Remember what Master Wu told us. Nya, you can make a flood to wash these guys out of here!

Nya: The only hope for water is if Jay has another accident in his pants.

Jay: Yeah, she’s right! We’ve gotta get out of here!

Zane: Ow, that hurts.

Lloyd: No! No, guys! Use your elemental powers! We have the power! Aaaaaah!!

(The Generals overwhelm the Ninja.
