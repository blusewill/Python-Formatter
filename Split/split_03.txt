Give me a birthday hug!

(Kai hugs Lloyd very tight.)

Lloyd: That's a good one.

Zane: Birthday hug? Let me get in on that.

Lloyd: (panicked) Zane-

Zane: I’ll increase the pressure dramatically.

Lloyd: Zane! Zane- Zane!

(Lloyd gets crushed. Nya skids round the corner on her motorbike.)

Nya: Oh-ho-ho, Lloyd!

Lloyd: Nya.

Nya: Yo bro.

Kai: What's up, sis?

Nya: Oh, hey, actual bro.

Jay: Hey, Nya! Where'd you get that bike? At the... great stuff store? Uh.

(Cole rolls his eyes at Jay.)

Nya: Guys. Check out my new paint job. ‘Cus I did it myself! The Lady Iron... Dragon. My hero!

Chad: Hey everyone, look. It's Garma-dork and the dork squad. You want to hear our new cheer?

Cheerleaders: ♪L-L-O-Y-D! His dad is bad and so is he! Boo Lloyd! Boo Lloyd!♪

Chad: BOO LLOYD!

Lloyd: (sarcastically) Great chant! I'll bet you got a number one hit on your hands!

(Scene cuts to the beach.)

Radio: And straight in at number one with a bullet, it’s “Boo Lloyd”! ♪L-L-O-Y-D! His dad is bad and so is he! Boo Lloyd! Boo Lloyd! Boooooooooo!♪

(As the song plays, the beach-goers start to notice something coming out of the water and advancing on the city. The whole city looks on in fear as Garmadon’s forces start to fly overhead.)

Garmadon: Citizens of Ninjago! Get ready to welcome your new overlord! Who goes by the name of...?

Citizen 1: Garmadon!

Garmadon: What’s my name?

Citizen 2: Garmadon!

Garmadon: Say it again?

Citizen 2: Garmadon!

Garmadon: I can't hear you!

Citizen 3: Garmadon!

Baby: Garmadon!

Garmadon: Don't wear it out. Okay. General number six!

General #6: Yes, sir!

Garmadon: You and your team of crab men overthrow the police station.

General #6: I can do that!

Garmadon: General number one! Take the TV station!

General #1: 10-4!

Michael: What?!

Garmadon: General number five! Crash the stock market!

General #5: Okie-do!

Garmadon: General number three, knock over that table. General number two! Pop that kid's balloon. General number four! Make the school bus dangle precariously over an overpass or something. I've never seen that before.

(The road is blocked and the bus skids, and stops with its back half hanging over a large drop.)

Garmadon: Now all I have to do is climb to the top of Ninjago Tower, and then I will rule over Ninjago.

Mayor: Wait, What?!

Garmadon: I said: "I will rule over Ninjago." Forever! (laughs maniacally)

Bus kid: Where are the ninjas?

(Cut to inside a classroom. Cole is listening to music on his headphones and humming. Kai is asleep in the back. The class suddenly notices the action outside.)

Ms. Laudita: Uh oh! It’s Garmadon!

Students: Thanks, Lloyd.

Ms. Laudita: You know what to do! Duck and cover!

Ninja: Can I have a bathroom pass?

Ms. Laudita: I think you mean: “May I”. “May I have a bathroom pass?” You know, do whatever you want.

(The Ninja race down the corridor towards their lockers.)

Kai: Come on, come on!

Ninja: Ninjaaaa GO!

(They step into their lockers, which take them from the school to the Ninja Mech Garage. They change into their gi on the way.)

Computer: Ninja Computer System initiated.

Nya: Come on!

Kai: Alright! Let’s go!

Lloyd: Ninja team! Shout out your call sign. Ha ha! Kai, light it up!

Kai: Fire Mech! So ninja.

Computer: Fire Mech ignited.

Kai: Alright, take it away, sis!

Nya: Water Mech! Ready and standing by. Zane!

Kai: Come on!

Lloyd: Your turn, buddy!

Zane: Ice Mech! Loading, loading, loading, loading.

Lloyd: Ready, Jay?

Jay: Yeah, yeah, I got this. Lightning Mech, ready! Wait, no, not ready. Ready!

Nya: Cole, do you want to get Garmadon’s butt?

Cole: Earth Mech!

Computer: Turntables at thirty three and a third RPM.

Cole: Ready and standing by.

Lloyd: Green Ninja! Ready and standing by.
