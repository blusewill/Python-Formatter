What, uh- what- wh- what were you saying? Ten and...?

Garmadon: Oh! Two! Two.

Lloyd: Two! Two...

Garmadon: Yes, ten and two.

Lloyd: Okay. Alright, alright.

Garmadon: It's kind of a rule of thumb in driving.

Lloyd: It's good to know. Good to know.

Garmadon: And don't forget to check your rear view. You wanna see what's back there. You’ve got blind spots everywhere in this thing.

Lloyd: Rear view check!

Garmadon: Keep your eyes peeled. You really want to be looking ahead.

Lloyd: (laughs) Noted. Thank you. You want me to really open this thing up?

Garmadon: Sure! Yeah, let's see what it can do.

Lloyd: Okay!

(The vehicle shoots forward super fast.)

Kai: WHOOOOOOO!

Cole: Yeahhh!

Jay: Whooo!

Kai: Wahoooo!

Garmadon: AAAAARGHHH!! Okay, that’s enough! That’s too fast!

(Lloyd slows down again.)

Lloyd: You didn’t like that?

Garmadon: I mean, I liked it. If I was driving, I'd be fine with it.

Lloyd: Sure, sure. I felt a little scared. Were you scared?

Garmadon: Uh, yeah! I’m not gonna lie, I might need a change of armour.

(Lloyd laughs.)

Garmadon: Yeah, I want you to guard the brake a little bit. Let’s-

Lloyd: Okay, okay, got it! Got it.

Garmadon: There you go. You’re doing great buddy! Doing great. This is going real- GOAT!

(A mountain reaches above the clouds with a goat standing on the top. The goat screams as Lloyd approaches.)

Garmadon: Goat goat goat goat goat! Aaargh!

(Lloyd swerves but crashes into the mountain. The vehicle spins and drops out of the sky. It skids across the ground and the Ninja jump off before it drops off the edge of a cliff.)

Lloyd: Is everyone okay?

Jay: Not really.

(The Ninja gasp as they look up at the temple.)

Garmadon: Behold. The Temple of Fragile Foundations.

(The Ninja cry out as the ground shakes.)

Garmadon: The helicopter crash destabilised the entire area. And I'm not blaming anyone, but if I ever see that goat again, he and I are going to have words. And you can bet some of those words are going to have four letters, and I'm not talking about goat.

Nya: Give us the first letter.

(The Ninja start to climb the stairs up towards the temple.)

Jay: This is my new least favourite place I've ever been.

Garmadon: I’ve spent a lot of time here. And trust me. Doesn't get any better.

Lloyd: Wait a minute. So... you know this place?

Garmadon: Who doesn’t know...

(Garmadon kicks dust off the welcome mat reading ‘The Garmadons’.)

Garmadon: ...their childhood home?

(The Ninja gasp.)

Garmadon: Yeah. This place is so unstable, I had to move to a volcano just to feel safe.

(Garmadon grabs a key from under the mat.)

Garmadon: Well? Shall we?

(Garmadon unlocks the door and they enter the dark hall.)

Garmadon: Stay close. I will lead you through this perilous-

Jay: Oh, look, a light switch!

(The hall lights up.)

Jay: You guys have a bathroom I could use?

Garmadon: No.

Nya: (gasps) Fresh fruit! Finally! Food!

Jay: I'm starving.

(Nya bites into an apple.)

Nya: Ow! Think I chipped a tooth.

Garmadon: Yeah. My parents were really into plastic food.

Cole: Whoa. Check out those old photos.

(The Ninja all gasp.)

Nya: Whoa!

Kai: Yeah! Look at that!

(The Ninja look at a photo of Wu and Garmadon as babies.)

Cole: Oh! They're so cute!

Nya: Look at his baby goatee!

Jay: I mean, Master Wu looks like a really old man.

(They look at a photo of Wu kicking Garmadon in the face.)

Cole: Ha ha! He even schooled you back then!

Garmadon: Ugh. Whatevs. Come on. Let's go find the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

(Lloyd sees a photo of Garmadon with someone familiar-looking.)

Lloyd: Wait. That's- that's you. And that's...

Nya: (gasps) It's Lady Iron Dragon, my hero!

Garmadon: Yes, Lady Iron Dragon. AKA: Luh-Lloyd's mom.

Lloyd: Wait, what? Mom was a ninja?

Garmadon: That's right. She was the most awesome ninja warrior I'd ever seen. I remember the... the first time I laid eyes on her.

(A flashback is shown.)

Garmadon: (narrating) It was during a raging war.
