(A boy enters a relic shop.)

Kid 1: (mockingly) See you later!

Kid 2: Come on, guys, leave him alone.

(The boy looks around the shop, which is full of many interesting items.)

Boy: Hello?

(The boy explores, playing among the shelves. He knocks a suit of armour, causing a flagpole to fall and launch a tray of teacups into the air. Mr. Liu catches them all expertly.)

Mr. Liu: (sternly) Boy...

(Mr. Liu kicks the flagpole back and places the cups back on the tray.)

Boy: Wow... That was amazing.

Mr. Liu: Why don't you play outside with your friends?

Boy: I don’t know.

(Children are heard laughing outside.)

Mr. Liu: Come here. You don't know, Huh?

Boy: Sometimes they make fun of me.

Mr. Liu: Hmm.

(The boy points at a snake in a jar.)

Boy: Is that real?

Mr. Liu: Yes, it's real. Everything here is real.

Boy: Whoa. Is that real?

(The boy points at a sleeping cat. Mr. Liu shows off the scratches on his hand.)

Mr. Liu: That cat is real. Real monster.

(The cat growls, and Mr Liu hisses back. He points to the toy in the boy’s hand.)

Mr. Liu: What's that?

Boy: This? This is Lloyd.

(Mr. Liu examines the figure closely. It is very scratched up and is missing an arm.)

Mr. Liu: Hmm. He looks like a very brave fighter.

Boy: No, he's just a kid. He can't do anything.

Mr. Liu: He might look different...

(Mr. Liu puts the figure in a cloth and pulls it out to reveal it in perfect condition, wearing a gi.)

Mr. Liu: ...but he can do great things.

Boy: Whoa...

Mr. Liu: You just have to look at it from a different point of view.

(Mr Liu puts out a box and blows the dust off of it, causing the boy to cough.)

Mr. Liu: Ah, duì bù qǐ. (sorry)

(Mr. Liu opens the box to reveal a wooden figure of Wu.)

Boy: Whoa...

Mr. Liu: This is his teacher. Very old. Very wise. And very handsome.

(The boy laughs.)

Mr. Liu: Have you ever heard the legend behind the legend of Ninjago?

Boy: No.

Mr. Liu: I would tell you, but to truly see you must forget everything, you know... and see things in a new way. The story of Ninjago... is the story of a boy. His name is Lloyd, and his dad is the worst guy in the history of the world.

(Transition into the Lego world, showing the port with many fishermen.)
