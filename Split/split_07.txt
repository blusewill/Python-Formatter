Wh- I don’t-

Nya: The dad- the dad stuff.

Lloyd: Yeah, but like exactly what are you referring to...?

Zane: Watching you and your father.

Cole: The vulnerability.

Jay: You got so emotional!

Lloyd: Emotion- emotions were the last thing that were- that was going on out there.

Nya: Uh, yeah.

Cole: Mhm.

Nya: It's okay, Lloyd. Nobody's parents are perfect.

Jay: I mean, my mom is weird and collects seashells. Your dad levels cities and attacks innocent people. So. They've all got their quirks, you know?

Cole: Uh- wh- where's that tranquil music coming from?

Nya: Hey look, everyone! Master Wu is back!

(As they watch the Destiny's Bounty dock, Master Wu suddenly appears behind them.)

Wu: Hello, students.

Ninja: Master Wu!

Zane: Shock.

Cole: How was your trip?

Wu: It was a deep spiritual journey that took me to depths inside myself I never knew existed.

Cole: Yeah, you have a pretty serious tan line.

Wu: Don’t judge me!

Nya: So, did you see us kick Garmadon’s butt?

Zane: We vanquished him.

Kai: Ba-ba-bam!

Wu: I saw your fight. And I saw Garmadon retreat. But you did not defeat him.

Ninja: What?!

Wu: There's nothing ninja about you ninjas.

Jay: We’re so ninja, I don't know what you’re talking about.

Wu: You will never truly defeat Garmadon... until you see things from a different point of view. You have the power to win the battle without fighting. When you start using your mind, you won’t need mechs and machines. Your call signs are not just cool names. They are the elemental powers you were all born with.

(As Wu names the Elements, he creates them to show the Ninja.)

Wu: Nya. You can create water on your own! And Kai. Fire!

Kai: Wow!

Wu: Jay! Lightning!

Jay: So ninja.

Wu: Cole. Earth.

Cole: We both spin!

Wu: And Zane. Ice.

Zane: Ice is nice!

Wu: These elemental powers are why I chose you to form the Secret Ninja Force. It is the highest level that you can achieve as a Ninja. I wrote a book about it! It's called: Ninjanuity! Copyright Master Wu.

Lloyd: And, uh, and- and what about me? What uh- what am I?

Wu: Lloyd, yours is the most important Element of all.

Lloyd: Okay! Hit me with it.

Wu: Your elemental power is... Green.

Lloyd: What's that?

Wu: Green.

Lloyd: Okay. So, uh, just to recap. Fire, Ice, Water, Earth, Lightning... and?

Wu: Green.

Lloyd: Don't think it's an Element though.

Wu: Lloyd.

Lloyd: Can I be Gold?

Wu: No.

Lloyd: Wind isn't taken. Can I be Wind?

Wu: No.

Lloyd: Earth, Green and Fire. Rolls right off the tongue.

Wu: Lloyd.

Lloyd: Could I be the element of... Surprise?

Wu: No. That's the Fuchsia Ninja.

Fuchsia Ninja: Surprise!

Lloyd: There are so many Elements left, this feels kind of purposeful that I don't have one.

Wu: Enough, Lloyd! Come with me for mentor talk. The rest of you, practice Spinjitzu.

Kai: That's easy. Watch this.

(They all start spinning.)

Zane: Exertion.

Wu: For three hours.

Jay: Three hours?!

Ninja: What?

Jay: Are you kidding me with this guy?

Wu: And read my book!

Jay: Oh, man!

Nya: Ugh.

(Aboard the Destiny’s Bounty, Master Wu and Lloyd talk.)

Lloyd: Master Wu, you don't understand. Right now, on that volcano, Garmadon is making something really big. He's building something huge, and something... surely shark-themed. And he's going to come back sooner rather than later. So what do I do?

Wu: Nephew, weapons alone will not solve your problem. I have every kind of weapon in my dojo. Big weapons, little weapons, sharp weapons, dull weapons, even the Ultimate Weapon, but the strongest weapon is inside you.

Lloyd: Wait, I'm- I’m sorry. What did you just say?

Wu: "The strongest weapon is inside you"?

Lloyd: No, no, no, no, no.
