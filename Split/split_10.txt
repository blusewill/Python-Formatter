physically impossible. I can't- How could I be crossing my fingers? I have these things.

(Garmadon waves his claw hands at Lloyd.)

Lloyd: I'm warning you, Garmadon!

Garmadon: Fine, no crossies! No crossies! Just chill. Okay, look, I'm getting rid of all my sharks, see? No sharks.

(Garmadon drops the sharks out of the tank on his mech.)

Lloyd: And the sharks in your ankle holster?

Garmadon: I don't have any sharks.

Lloyd: What's in your ankle?

Garmadon: It’s a cup of dolphins, man! Come- Now you’re acting loco! I mean- This is just-

Lloyd: Get rid of ‘em!

Garmadon: Fine.

(Garmadon shakes the dolphins out of the ankle holster.)

Garmadon: You happy now? I'm done. You win.

(Garmadon starts to advance on Lloyd.)

Lloyd: What are you doing? What are you doing right now?

Garmadon: Easy, Green Ninja.

Lloyd: Don't come any closer!

Garmadon: Easy...

Lloyd: I'm warning you, Garmadon!

Garmadon: Let's just keep this interaction very chill.

Lloyd: I'm the definition of chill right now!

Garmadon: I know!

(Lloyd almost steps backwards off the edge of the tower.)

Lloyd: Stand back!

Garmadon: Put down the Ultimate Weapon, Green Ninja. We both know you're not going to fire it.

Lloyd: Oh yeah? This is your last chance. Get out of Ninjago. Now and forever!

Garmadon: No.

Lloyd: Alright, fine. You ready for this?

Garmadon: Yeah!

Lloyd: It's coming!

Garmadon: Okay!

Lloyd: You’ve been warned!

Garmadon: I'm waiting!

Lloyd: Here it comes!

Garmadon: Anytime!

Lloyd: Alright! Here... it... comes!

(Lloyd fires the Ultimate Weapon, which doesn’t destroy Garmadon, but instead just puts a laser point on his mech.)

Garmadon: Oh my gosh! He actually shot-! And it exploded! And then-! But nothing... is happening. Why is nothing happening?

Lloyd: What the heck?

Garmadon: It’s like the Ultimate Lamest Weapon.

Lloyd: Come on! Why won't you work?

(Trying to get the Ultimate Weapon work, Lloyd accidentally points it down at the city below. The citizens and soldiers all pause to look at the dot as rumbling footsteps are heard.)

Garmadon: You hear that?

(Lloyd looks around, afraid.)

Garmadon: What have you done?

(The monster appears, revealing itself to be... a giant cat: Meowthra.)

All: Awww!

(Meowthra knocks down the building that the Ultimate Weapon is pointed at. The citizens and soldiers all run away screaming.)

Lloyd: How- how do I turn this thing off?

Garmadon: Ah!

Lloyd: Come on!

Garmadon: Generals! Grab the Green Ninja!

(Garmadon jumps out of his mech and his Generals surround Lloyd.)

Lloyd: Keep away!

(Garmadon kicks Lloyd, knocking the Ultimate Weapon out of his hands and almost causing him to fall off the tower. Garmadon catches the Ultimate Weapon and the Generals pin Lloyd to the ground.)

Lloyd: Hey- wait! No, no no!

Garmadon: Remember, Green Ninja. I didn't fire this thing first, that's on you. But! Since you've got it all warmed up... let’s try it on some moving targets!

(Garmadon points the Ultimate Weapon at the Ninja’s mechs, causing Meowthra to attack them.)

Lloyd: No!

(The laser shines in Cole’s eyes.)

Cole: What the heck?!

Lloyd: Stop it, Garmadon, just stop it!

Nya: What is this thing?!

Jay: I’m gonna throw up!

Zane: Prolonged scream!

Garmadon: Five ninjas down. One to go.

(Using his mech, Garmadon kicks Lloyd’s dragon mech off of the tower.)

Garmadon: Bang! I win! Cue the music!

(A Shark Army DJ plays upbeat music as they all celebrate. Garmadon makes his way through the crowd towards Lloyd.)

Garmadon: What? Are you gonna cry?

Lloyd: I'm not gonna cry.

Soldier: I bet he’s gonna cry.

(Garmadon and the soldiers laugh.)

Lloyd: I'm not gonna cry... dad.

(They all gasp, and the record skips. It keeps scratching for a long, long time.)

Garmadon: Luh-Lloyd?

Lloyd: That's right. It's me. Your son! And it's Lloyd, dad!

Garmadon: No. L-L-O-Y-D.
