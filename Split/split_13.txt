Feel the energy flowing through you.

(The ninja start doing exercises.)

Wu: Good, good. The power... is inside you. Now, say to yourself, “I've got the power!”

(Wu plays The Power by Snap! on his staff. The Ninja move in time to the music.)

Ninja: I’ve got the power!

(Wu suddenly hears a scuttling noise and stops.)

Wu: What was that?

(Garmadon is stalking the Ninja. He crawls across the floor and tastes some soil.)

Garmadon: Hmm. Ninja tracks.

(Wu catches some dust out of the air and sniffs it.)

Wu: I sense the presence of evil. Students! A true ninja knows when to fight, and when to become one with the elements. Quickly! Blend in the shadows!

(The Ninja make pathetic attempts to camouflage themselves.)

Wu: You are all terrible ninjas. I will take care of Garmadon on my own.

Garmadon: I'm close.

Wu: He’s close.

Garmadon: Real close.

Wu: Really close!

(They suddenly realise they are standing right next to each other.)

Both: You!

(They glare at each other, getting closer until they are literally face to face.)

Garmadon: Oh! Hello brother. Where are your little ninja- ninja nerd- where are your little ninj-nerds? Pft. Nailed it.

Wu: They're surrounding you, perfectly hidden, ready to strike.

Garmadon: Oh, really?

(They look at the Ninja, completely failing to hide.)

Cole: Caw caw! Caw caw!

Wu: Students! Next lesson: how to fight like a true ninja- ow!

(Wu gets hit by Garmadon, and Lloyd winces. Wu hits Garmadon back.)

Garmadon: Ow! Aaaargh!

(They fight. Wu gets many hits on Garmadon until he takes cover between two bamboo stalks. He then uses the bamboo to launch himself at Wu, knocking his hat off. Garmadon catches it and puts it on his own head.)

Garmadon: Oh, Look at me. I'm Master Wu! Today's lesson is something totally boring.

(Wu hits Garmadon many times, and gets his hat back.)

Wu: Looks like you need a lesson, in learning how to shut your stupid face!

Garmadon: Well, here's something you won't learn in school. The Seven Deadly Butterflies of Shaolin! One two three four five six seven!

Wu: I don’t need a deadly butterfly to beat you!

Jay: We are totes blending in right now.

Wu: I can still see you!

Nya: Aw, man!

Lloyd: Come on, this way!

(Wu and Garmadon fight onto the Bridge of Fallen Mentors. Wu drops his staff, and they both scramble to grab it. Wu pulls it out of the bridge, flinging a panel into Garmadon’s face.)

Wu: Ho ho. Wu’s your daddy?

(Wu continues flinging panels at Garmadon. Garmadon manages to get close, but gets his foot stuck on Wu’s head.)

Wu: Get off of my head!

Garmadon: Hey, bro, get off my foot!

Wu: Get off! Get off!

Garmadon: Get off my foot so I can kick you in the head!

(They detach and continue fighting. The Ninja catch up with them.)

Lloyd: Master Wu! Look out, he’s behind you!

Wu: Where?

(Garmadon rips off Wu’s robes.)

Garmadon: Really? Tighty whities? Still? Face it! You're out of moves, Wu.

Wu: Oh, yeah? How ‘bout this one?

Garmadon: Uh oh.

(Wu uses bamboo stalks to build a cage around Garmadon.)

Wu: I call it: ‘The Caged Monkey’!

Garmadon: Oh, you have got to be kidding me!

(The Ninja gasp.)

Zane: Gasp.

Wu: And that, my students, is how you fight like a true ninja.

Garmadon: Huh. Well, a true ninja... would have counted all seven butterflies.

Wu: What? I did! One, two, three, four, five, six...

Garmadon: Seven.

(The seventh butterfly floats next to Wu. Startled, he steps backwards, falling off the bridge into the river below.)

Wu: Whoa!

Lloyd: Nooo!

(The Ninja watch as Wu’s hat floats to the surface. A few seconds later, Wu surfaces as well.)

Ninja: Master Wu!

Wu: Lloyd! Always remember!

Lloyd: Yeah?

Wu: Stay on the right path, to find your inner peace!

(Wu gets swept away by the river.)

Kai: No, no, no, no!

Nya: Oh my gosh!

Jay: Master Wu! We need you, please!

Nya: Master Wu!

Jay: Don't leave!

Lloyd: Uncle Wu...

Nya: Did he say... “inner peace”?

Jay: “The right path”? Why is he bringing these things up so late in our adventure?

Garmadon: Well, well, well. It looks like your precious ninja master’s gone.
