Now come on, Luh-Lloyd. Open the cage. Let out your papa.

Lloyd: So now you want to be my dad?

Garmadon: I'm not going to ask you again, Luh-Lloyd. Open the cage, right now. One! Two! Three! ...Hm. I thought that was supposed to work with kids. Listen, Luh-Lloyd, and friends whose names I don't know.

Jay: I'm Jay!

Garmadon: It's not a question!

Jay: Oh.

Garmadon: Now! For you to make it through this journey alive, you're going to need someone to teach you the ninja way.

Lloyd: What do you know about being a ninja?

Garmadon: Oh, I know plenty, Luh-Lloyd. You don't get to be a warlord without knowing a thing or two about the ninja arts. The dark ninja arts.

(Garmadon hisses and shakes his cage.)

Jay: Aargh! What is that?

Kai: You're a ninja?

Garmadon: Indeed I am. As a matter of fact, I wrote the book on Ninjelligence.

Jay: Why are there so many one-star reviews?

Garmadon: I think that's trolls, personally.

Jay: Oh.

Lloyd: We don't need your book, Garmadon. Wu is our master.

Garmadon: Well, Wu is gone. And you’re gonna need me to get you out of this jungle, or you're all going to die.

Jay: Oh, great! We're all going to die.

Lloyd: We're not going to die, Jay.

Garmadon: And while I'm keeping you alive, maybe I'll teach you some of my sick dark ninja moves. ‘The Buzzkill’!

Ninja: Wow!

Garmadon: ‘The Miso Slap’!

Ninja: Wow!

Garmadon: Or ‘The Chainsaw Chop’!

Ninja: Wow!

Garmadon: Or ‘The Dance of Doom’!

Ninja: Wow!

Lloyd: Hang on, just a second. This is Garmadon we're talking about. We can still make it to the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon on our own. We just have to remember what Master Wu taught us.

Cole: All I can remember is we really need a ninja master. And you are not a ninja master.

Kai: So what are we going to do?

Lloyd: (sighs) We take him.

Garmadon: Fantastic.

(Later in the day, the Ninja are travelling with Garmadon.)

Garmadon: You know what's funny? I had Luh-Lloyd when I was a hundred and fifty eight years old.

Jay: Wow.

Nya: Wait a minute. You're a hundred and seventy four?

Garmadon: Yes.

Cole: Master Wu says he's a hundred and sixty seven. And he's your... younger brother?

Garmadon: He's my younger brother, correct.

Cole: How is that possible? You look much...

Ninja: Younger.

Garmadon: Thank you.

Jay: Yeah, do you moisturise?

Garmadon: Yes, that's when I got the upper hand on Master Wu.

Jay: Upper hands.

Garmadon: Yeah. Upper hands.

Kai: How did you gain two arms?

Jay: Oh, don't put it like that. We’ve told you not to say it like that.

Nya: I don’t know if that’s the best way to say it.

Kai: Well, he's got four arms!

Zane: Correct!

Garmadon: You know, a lot of people don't ask me about it, so it's- I'm glad that he's comfortable asking. Luh-Lloyd's never asked me once about my arms, have you, Lloyd?

Lloyd: Don't... talk to me.

Garmadon: I was bit by a snake.

Kai: No...

Garmadon: Yes.

Jay: So the snake had a bunch of arms?

Kai: They don't have arms.

Zane: Exactly.

Jay: Do you mean like, a spider?

Garmadon: Oh no. I was bit by a snake, and the snake had been bitten by a spider, and then the snake bit me.

Jay: Oh...

Lloyd: Are you guys actually buying any of this?

Garmadon: How else would you explain it, Luh-Lloyd? You weren't there.

Jay: So when the two extra arms started growing, were you like, “Yes! This is awesome!”, or were you like “Oh, no”?

Garmadon: No! At first I was like, totally freaked out, and sometimes I get self-conscious about it.

Jay: ...Hey, uh, Garmadon? Can I ask you another question?

Garmadon: Yeah, go ahead.

Jay: It's about the arms. Um. Can you shake your own hand?

Garmadon: Look! Check it out, ninjas.

(Garmadon holds his top two hands in his bottom two hands.)

Nya: Oh my gracious.

Jay: Oh! He's his own best friend!

Kai: Ahh, the double shake!

Zane: I love your bad boy charm.

Garmadon: Look at this.
