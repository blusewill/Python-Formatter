We just ate! Aah!

(Cole knocks her out. Up in a lookout tower, Jay rubs his scarf to create a static charge and shocks the guard. The Ninja regroup on a roof.)

Nya: Time to blend in.

(The Ninja knock out various Generals and steal their clothes to use as disguises. The Generals start pushing the cage towards the volcano.)

Generals: (chanting) Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him! Fire him!

(The Generals continue chanting.)

Garmadon: Luh-Lloyd.

Lloyd: Yeah?

Garmadon: Um. I-

(The Ninja knock out the Generals by the cage.)

Ninja: Lloyd!

Lloyd: Guys!

Garmadon: Oh, hey!

Lloyd: Oh my gosh! How did you all get up here?

Kai: Oh man, we did all that stuff that you and Master Wu told us to do. Ninja style, bruh.

Lloyd: Who-o-oa.

Nya: Alright. Let's get out of here, and make it to the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

Garmadon: It's not going to be easy, girl ninja. Because I fired a ridic amount of Generals.

Lloyd: Alright, alright, I got an idea. If we can hold these generals off long enough, we can build away out of here.

Garmadon: Great idea. You kids start building. Luh-Lloyd and I will throw you bricks.

(The Ninja start building.)

Kai: Lloyd, I need a two-by-two!

Lloyd: Here it comes!

(Lloyd throws and the brick goes behind him.)

Zane: That was terrible.

Nya: Throw me a couple of one-bys!

Lloyd: I got it! Check this out!

(Lloyd throws and it lands right in front of him.)

Kai: How can you be so bad at this?

Cole: Yeah, you got like a mental block?

Garmadon: Hang on, everybody. You ninjas just keep at it. Luh-Lloyd, you're coming with me. I'll be in charge of the tunes. I'll just put it on shuffle here. Please not Jim Croce, please not Jim Croce.

(I Got A Name by Jim Croce starts playing.)

Garmadon: Aargh! Jinxed us. Alright, ninjas, keep building! Luh-Lloyd, I’m gonna teach you how to throw.

(The Ninja start to roll their vehicle down the volcano and they continue to add to it. Lloyd and Garmadon head to the rooftops. Garmadon demonstrates a throwing action and Lloyd copies as the Ninja fight off Generals. Lloyd attempts to throw a brick, but fails. Garmadon smiles at him supportively. Lloyd tries again, and Garmadon corrects his posture. Lloyd is now able to throw easily, hitting a cat, a building, and a window.)

Garmadon: Run for it!

(The Ninja continue building and fighting off Generals.)

Cole: Lloyd! Over here! I’m open.

Lloyd: Okay, right, I can- I can do this.

Garmadon: Quiet your mind, Luh-Lloyd.

Lloyd: Okay.

Garmadon: Throw like no one's watching except your judging father.

Lloyd: Not helping!

Garmadon: Oh, right! You got this. Do it.

(Lloyd throws the brick. It hits Cole directly in the face, knocking him and the other Ninja off the vehicle.)

Garmadon: Ah! Luh-Lloyd!

Lloyd: Yes!

Garmadon: Look at that! I actually taught you how to do something!

Lloyd: Right?!

(The Ninja climb back onto the vehicle and cheer for Lloyd. Lloyd starts throwing more bricks.)

Lloyd: Cole, catch! Kai!

Kai: Right here! I’m open!

Lloyd: Jay! Your turn, buddy!

(Garmadon watches and smiles proudly.)

Kai: You’ve got a cannon for an arm!

Nya: Seriously an awesome throw!

(Lloyd and Garmadon board the vehicle.)

Garmadon: Luh-Lloyd! Something's happening to my face! It's turning upwards in an unfamiliar motion. Oh, I think they deployed nerve gas! It's happening to you too!

Lloyd: Listen, listen, we're smiling!

Garmadon: What is this... smiling?

Lloyd: Go with it! Feels good, right?

Garmadon: It does! Oh, this whole experience is so foreign to me!

(Lloyd starts climbing a tower.)

Lloyd: I know, right?

Garmadon: Yeah!

(Lloyd picks up a propeller and gets ready to throw it to Garmadon.)

Lloyd: Alright, here it comes!

(Olivia sneaks up behind Lloyd.)

Garmadon: Luh-Lloyd!

(Olivia tackles Lloyd and knocks him onto the ground. She stands over him with a sword.)

Olivia: Time to fire you ou- AAAHHH!

(Olivia gets hit by the Ninja’s vehicle. Garmadon runs over.)

Garmadon: Luh-Lloyd! Luh-Lloyd, are you okay?

Lloyd: Yeah, yeah, I think- I think it was my arm.
