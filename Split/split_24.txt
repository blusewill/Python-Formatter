I'm just- I'm just so happy you're all right.

Lloyd: No, mom, I'm really sorry. I took you for granted. All you ever did was support me. The real me, the person I am on the inside.

Koko: Oh.

(Lloyd and Koko hug.)

Lloyd: I’m really sorry, mom.

Koko: I love you so much.

Lloyd: I love you too.

Garmadon: Bring it in. Let's hug this out.

(Garmadon attempts to join the hug but Koko pushes him away.)

Garmadon: Okay! That's cool. Uh... got two people to hug me over here!

(Garmadon wraps his arms around himself.)

Lloyd: Uncle Wu? I know why you wanted me to be the Green Ninja.

Wu: Oh, you do?

Lloyd: Yeah. Green is the colour of life. It flows through all living things... connecting them all. The way I connect the ninjas.

(Lloyd sees memories of him and the other Ninja training. The Ninja play a game together, but quickly pretend to be studying when Wu enters.)

Lloyd: Or... the way I connect my family... whether we're together or not.

Wu: Some powers are ones you cannot see, but those are the most important powers of all.

(Lloyd smile at Wu and Garmadon ruffles his hair. Wu steps forward to talk to the camera.)

Wu: Lloyd was a hero.

Garmadon: Who are you talking to?

(Wu starts to float with the camera above the crowd.)

Wu: He saved Garmadon! And he saved his family.

Garmadon: We're standing right here.

Wu: And the whole city of Ninjago.

Garmadon: Where are you going?

Wu: They even made Meowthra the mascot!

Citizen 1: She’s so fluffy, I love her!

Garmadon: Wu! Come back!

(Koko and Nya are shown training Shark Generals.)

Wu: Koko and Nya opened a school to teach former Shark Generals life skills.

(Lloyd, Koko, and Garmadon are shown eating at a restaurant.)

Wu: And Garmadon taught Lloyd something very important.

Garmadon: Hey! Catch!

(Garmadon throws a bunch of bowls at Lloyd, who catches them all. The scene transitions back to real life.)

Mr. Liu: And Lloyd taught everyone that even if you're different, you can still do great things.

Boy: Whoa. So does that mean I’m a ninja now?

Mr. Liu: No. All you did was listen to a story. Doesn't make you a martial artist.

Boy: Or does it?

(The boy kicks and punches energetically.)

Mr. Liu: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Listen. To be a master... it takes patience, hard work, courage... and...

(Mr. Liu knocks a cup off the desk and the boy catches it without looking.)

Boy: Whoa...

Mr. Liu: Good. Your training begins at dawn.

Boy: Whoa!

Mr. Liu: Whoa!

Boy: Can we bring the cat?

Mr. Liu: No!

(Mr. Liu looks at the cat, who growls.)
