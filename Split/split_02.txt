He fights in the air, on the ground and in the kitchen, with a refrigerator. But what is he hiding, and who is he really?

Voice-over 2: LOCAL BIRTHDAYS!

Robin: Celebrating birthdays today are this hot dog guy, this panda and... uh oh. Lloyd Garmadon!

Michael: The son of the evil Lord Garmadon.

Robin: Must be tough to be that kid.

(Scene changes to Lloyd’s home, part of a huge apartment block.)

Lloyd’s phone: ♪Jump up, kick back, whip around and spin! And then we jump back, do it again! Ninja! GO! Ninja! G-♪

Lloyd: Hello?

(Garmadon is in his pyjamas, eating cereal.)

Garmadon: Hello? What do you want?

Lloyd: Uh... you called me.

Garmadon: Hang on a second. Let me- Hm. Must've butt-dialled you. Who is this?

Lloyd: (sighs) It's Lloyd. Lloyd Garmadon, your son?

Garmadon: No. my son is totally bald and has no teeth.

Lloyd: Yeah, well, surprise. I'm not a baby anymore.

Garmadon: Duly noted. How old are you? You're seven, right, you're seven?

Lloyd: Sixteen.

Garmadon: Huh.

Lloyd: (under his breath) Just add nine to that...

Garmadon: Well, good talk son.

Lloyd: Wait, are you sure there, there isn't a special reason why you might've called me today, on this day, specifically, todaaaaay?

Garmadon: Look, I didn't call you, my butt called you.

Lloyd: ...Oh.

Garmadon: Well, no time to chat. Sorry, Dad has gotta go to work. I've got to get that Green Ninja.

Lloyd: Yeah.

Garmadon: Glad the teeth finally came in. Buh-bye!

(Garmadon hangs up on Lloyd. Cut to later in the morning, when Lloyd is washing dishes.)

Koko: Lloooyd! Good mooorniiiing!

Lloyd: Mom, hey. Um, here's a thought. What if I... didn't... go to school today?

Koko: What? Oh, no, you don't want to miss school, honey. These are the best years of your life!

Lloyd: Um, have you, have you been... to high school? ‘Cus uh. It's judgy. Pretty judgy.

Koko: Oh, honey. You just need to give them a chance to see the real you.

Lloyd: Yeah. I don't think I can actually show people the real... me.

Koko: That's not true. All you've got to do is to show them the person you are on the inside.

(Koko touches Lloyd's heart.)

Koko: Right here, where it matters most. Oh! And also, don't forget: if your dad attacks the city again today, just be sure to-

Both: Duck and cover until the secret ninjas give the all-clear.

Koko: Oh, and also don't forget...

Lloyd: Yeah?

Koko: Have a happy birthday, honey.

(Koko kisses Lloyd’s cheek.)

Lloyd: Thanks mom. I’ll try my best.

Koko: Of course you will!

(Lloyd starts his journey to school. Operation New Me by Jingle Punks plays. Lloyd approaches a group of kids at the bus stop.)

Lloyd: Hello!

(The other kids look uncomfortable and start typing on their phones. “🚨 LLOYD ALERT 🚨”, “AGAIN? when 🚌 !!”, “😡😡😡😡😡”, “his dad has scary eyes 👀”, “CAN’T 👏 HE 👏 GET 👏 A 👏 RIDE”, “like father like son”, “WORST 🚌🛑”, 🚫 LLOYD 🚫”, “👎”, “👎”, “👎”, “new phone... who dis?”. Lloyd gets on the School Bus. As soon as he steps on, the other kids stop messing around and sit, scowling at him. Lloyd walks timidly up the aisle.)

Lloyd: Hey...

(Lloyd takes a window seat on the right side of the bus. The other kids immediately all move onto the left.)

Lloyd: Cool...

(Lloyd looks out the window, smiling, but his face quickly falls into a sad expression. The left side of the bus scrapes along the road as it drives off. When they arrive at school, the bus driver slams the doors behind Lloyd the second he steps off. The school goes silent as the students stare at Lloyd. They start to whisper to each other as he walks past them.)

Girl: That’s the kid I was telling you about. His dad ruins everything.

(Zane suddenly appears beside Lloyd.)

Zane: Hello, fellow teenager.

Lloyd: Zane, hey.

Zane: Man, my mom is on my case all the time. She's all, "(dial-up sounds)", and I'm like, "Lay off, mom. I'm just a teenager."

Lloyd: I hear that.

(They walk through the main entrance as the bell rings. Kai shouts from across the corridor.)

Kai: BRO! Dude, give me a hug, man.
