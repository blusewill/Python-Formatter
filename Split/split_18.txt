Is- is- is it bad?

(Lloyd turns to reveal his right arm is completely missing.)

Garmadon: Whoa!

Lloyd: Is it bad? I don’t wanna look. I don't wanna look.

Garmadon: Uhh... It looks okay? I guess? Um...

(The rest of the Ninja surround Lloyd with shocked expressions.)

Lloyd: Sc- scale of one to ten, how bad is it?

Garmadon: Oh, I'd say it's about a seven... point... arm-ripped-off?

Lloyd: My arm is what?! What did you- say it one more time?

Garmadon: Just- ju- ju- don’t look down, don't look down below your neck.

Lloyd: Why’re you- don't do that face. Why are you doing that face?

Garmadon: It's just a harmless little- (gags) I gotta puke. It's disgusting.

Lloyd: Should I look? Aaaargh! I looked, I have no arm! I have no arm! Noooo!

Garmadon: I told you it was bad.

Lloyd: Aargh! That's way worse than anything I could have thought! That's bad.

Garmadon: You're going to be fine! Let me text your mother.

Lloyd: Dad, no! I need you! Stay with me, be here with me right now, alright? Do something!

Garmadon: I- Alright- I’ll find- I’m gonna find it. Uh- what does it look like?

Lloyd: It- it looks like my left arm, except it's the right one?

Garmadon: Oh, of course, yes. Okay. Everybody fan out, form a grid. Find Luh-Lloyd’s arm. Got a little hand like a cup holder and a black sleeve and a... little piece of green on it. Ehh... You'll know it when you see it. It's Luh-Lloyd’s arm, for heaven's sake!

(Garmadon pulls up a crab claw.)

Garmadon: This look like it?

Lloyd: No.

Garmadon: Alright. Let's try this arm out.

(Garmadon pulls up a General’s leg.)

Lloyd: That's a leg.

Garmadon: Have you ever had an arm that kicks? I mean, that could be cool!

Lloyd: Can't say I have.

Garmadon: Uh... Hey, how about this one?

(Garmadon pulls up a large sword.)

Lloyd: (sighs) That's a sword! That's a sword.

Garmadon: Oh man. Have a sword arm, that'd be sweet.

Lloyd: Ugh, you know, the idea of it's a lot cooler than the reality.

Garmadon: Uh... Oh- oh- wait- wait a minute! Found it!

(Garmadon pulls up Lloyd’s arm.)

Lloyd: Here we go!

Garmadon: Okay. I'm going to pop that arm back into place.

Lloyd: Okay, wait- wait, but it's- it’s- it’s only gonna- it's only gonna hurt for a second, right?

Garmadon: “For a second”? No! It's going to be agony for a while! Like, who gave you that misinformation?

Lloyd: Alright, alright, alright, just do it! Just do it! Just do it!

Garmadon: Okay. On the count of twelve.

Lloyd: No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't wanna do twelve. I don't wanna- Let's do, let's do like a- you know, three?

Garmadon: Okay, uh. Three.

(Garmadon moves the arm closer to Lloyd.)

Garmadon: One, two...

(Garmadon suddenly pulls the arms away.)

Garmadon: Ah! I wish your mom was here to do this.

Lloyd: You're killing me! You gotta- you gotta just do it.

Garmadon: Alright. One! Two! Three!

(Garmadon clicks Lloyd’s arm back into place.)

Lloyd: Wow. It uh... feels, uh... feels pretty good!

(Garmadon sighs with relief.)

Lloyd: It's pretty good! (laughs) You did that. Put my arm back on, like a real dad.

Garmadon: You- you called me dad!

Lloyd: Yeah.

Garmadon: Wow! I guess I- I guess I did! I really stepped up there, in kind of a dad way.

Lloyd: (laughs) Right?

Jay: Lloyd! Come on! We gotta get out of here!

(Lloyd and the other Ninja run to the vehicle as Generals chase after them.)

Zane: Guys, we have to go! Hurry! Hurry!

(The Ninja start up the vehicle, now with the propeller attached.)

Lloyd: Come on! Let’s get moving.

Garmadon: Come on, everybody. Let’s go.

(The vehicle flies up and away from the Generals.)

Nya: I can’t believe it worked!

Garmadon: Temple, here we come!

(The Ninja fly above the clouds.)

Garmadon: Hey, Luh-Lloyd, look- let me show you how to fly this thing. Hands ten and two.

Lloyd: (laughs) I build and drive mechs all the time, I think I'm good.

Garmadon: Oh, okay, yeah, you’re... probably right, and... (sighs)

(Lloyd notices Garmadon looking sad.)

Lloyd: Um...
