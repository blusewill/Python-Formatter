Meanwhile, Meowthra mews at Garmadon who laughs and throws a piece at her.)

Garmadon: Take that!

(Meowthra just mews again.)

Garmadon: Gh- what?

(The Ninja encounter more soldiers.)

Lloyd: Zane, freeze these guys out!

Zane: Copy.

(Zane creates a wall of ice.)

Lloyd: Kai, make a smokescreen!

Kai: Yeah, baby! F-f-fuego!

(Kai melts the ice, creating a mist.)

Shark Soldier 1: Where’d they go?

Shark Soldier 2: I can’t see them anywhere!

(Garmadon is still confused by the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.)

Garmadon: Eh- what? How ‘bout this?! Hi-yah!

(Garmadon throws more pieces at Meowthra.)

Garmadon: These things aren’t working!

(The Ninja fight more soldiers.)

Lloyd: Jay! Now’s your chance, buddy!

Jay: Roger that.

(Jay jumps and shocks a bunch of soldiers out of the sky. Heroes by Blaze n Vill plays.)

Cole: Let’s rock!

(Cole punches the ground and knocks the forces back. The Ninja all join together again.)

Garmadon: Hey! Cat! Back off! I’m Garmadon, baby! I'm the greatest warlord of all- Aaahh!

(Meowthra eats Garmadon.)

Garmadon: Oh! Somebody help me!

Lloyd: Dad?

Citizen 1: Go, ninjas, go!

Chad: Hip, hip hooray! The cat ate Garmadon!

Pilates Studio Owner: Now all they have to do is take out the cat and Ninjago is safe!

Citizen 2: Get ‘em!

Citizen 3: Take out that monster!

Citizen 4: Whack that cat with your awesome hand powers!

Garmadon: Luh-Lloyd! Please help me!

Kai: Oh, I can use my fire! But is that... too much?

Nya: Or I could blast them with my water! Cats hate water!

Lloyd: You were right, Master Wu. I need to walk the path that only the son of Garmadon can walk.

(Wu nods at Lloyd. Lloyd steps forward and takes off his mask, causing the citizens to gasp.)

Chad: Oh, my gosh. the Green Ninja is... Lloyd Garmadon?

Koko: (gasps) Lloyd!

Jay: All we have to do is scare off Meowthra and we've won!

Lloyd: ...No.

Jay: What?!

Kai: Uh, Lloyd. Where are you going?

Zane: Lloyd? Come back!

Lloyd: (clicks his tongue) Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. (whistles and clicks)

(Meowthra walks towards Lloyd.)

Lloyd: (whispering) Yeah. Come here.

Koko: Lloyd! No!

Wu: It's okay. He's got this.

Lloyd: That’s a good kitty. You're okay. Yeah, you’re okay.

(Meowthra breathes on Lloyd, blowing on him roughly.)

Lloyd: Shhh, yeah. Yeah, that’s a good kitty. What a sweet, sweet kitty.

(Lloyd strokes Meowthra’s nose.)

Lloyd: Everything's going to be just fine. Hey. I know it. I know you don't mean to destroy everything. (sighs) When, uh- when people look at you... they see a monster. But... I know that you just- you just feel scared... and alone.

(Garmadon listens inside of Meowthra.)

Lloyd: I know how that feels. To be judged unfairly. So, um. Just want to say that... I forgive you. And... I'm sorry. When I said, “I wish you weren't my father”... I didn't really mean it. What I- What I should have said is... I wish we didn't fight all the time. I’m- I just- I wish I could have spent... more time with you. And that- that you could have seen, like, everything I've been through. But- but you weren't there. And it- I just- I don’t- I- I wish we could get that time back. I need my dad. I just- I need my dad.

(Garmadon cries a fiery tear which causes Meowthra to cough him up.)

Garmadon: Oh! Whoa! Whoa.

Lloyd: Dad? Are- are- are you okay?

Garmadon: Yeah. Fine.

Lloyd: You’re alive!

Garmadon: Son?

Lloyd: Yeah?

Garmadon: Did you... mean all that stuff you said? To the cat?

Lloyd: (laughs) Every word.

Garmadon: Well. I know for a fact that the cat feels exactly the same way. (sniffs)

Lloyd: Dad? Are you... crying?

Garmadon: (clearly choking up) Ugh- No. It's just that I’m... kinda allergic to the cat. (sobs)

(Koko runs over and hugs Lloyd.)

Koko: Lloyd!

Lloyd: Mom!

Koko: Let me- let me look at you. Let me look at you. Are you hurt? Let me see your fingers and toes. Okay. You still don't have fingers and toes, that's good! Is everything okay?

Lloyd: I’m- I’m fine. I'm- I'm good.

Koko: Lloyd, I was so worried about you!

Lloyd: Mom. Mom, wait! I'm, uh- I’m sorry.

Koko: It's okay.
