is inside you.

Lloyd: “Inner peace”?

(Lloyd remembers the elemental pieces.)

Past Wu: Find your inner piece!

Lloyd: “Inner piece”, inner piece! Guys! Guys, we don't need those pieces! The Ultimate Ultimate Weapon is inside of you!

Nya and Jay: What?!

Lloyd: Yes, you have the power! Look within. Harness what you already have inside and let it out! I believe in each of you! Nya, you can create water. Kai? You can make fire.

Kai: Okay. Alright, I can make fire.

(The Ninja start trying to harness their powers.)

Lloyd: The power is inside of all of you. Now calm your mind, concentrate, build up your power. Just think about Earth! Fire! Water! Ice! And you, Jay! Lightning, baby, do it! Jay, you got the power! Say, “I’ve got the power”!

(Jay starts to spark with electricity.)

Jay: I’ve got the power!

(I’ve Got The Power by Snap! Plays. Jay knocks down the door with his lightning. Part of the roof starts to fall on the Ninja, but Cole knocks it back with his powers.)

Cole: I’ve got the power!

Lloyd: Good work, Cole! Go, go, go!

(More falling rubble knocks out the stairs. Nya and Zane combine their powers to make an ice bridge.)

Nya: I’ve got the power!

Zane: I, too, have the power!

Nya: Here we go, come on, hurry up!

(A large lion head statue starts sliding down towards the Ninja.)

Jay: What now?

Lloyd: Kai! Your turn!

Kai: Got it. I’ve got the power!

(Kai shoots his flame at the statue, which continues sliding, but is now on fire.)

Kai: I think I made it worse!

Wu: (off screen, echoing) Jump, Lloyd! Jump!

Lloyd: Master Wu? (to the Ninja) Guys, I can hear the dead. And Master Wu says... Jump!

(The Ninja jump off the cliff and land safely on the Destiny’s Bounty below, which is being piloted by Wu.)

Wu: (through a megaphone) Great job, students!

Ninja: (gasp) Master Wu!

Lloyd: You're alive!

Wu: Of course. I'm a ninja master, who lives life on the edge, and cheats death at every turn.

Jay: Wow!

Nya: Really?

Wu: No! I thought being dead would make you listen to me more. And I was right!

Jay: Master Wu! We found our elemental powers!

Cole: All because Lloyd wouldn't give up on our training.

Nya: Lloyd saved us!

Zane: He also decoded your needlessly cryptic metaphors!

Wu: Lloyd, I'm so proud of you. You helped your friends be great. And that makes you truly a ninja master. Now, let's go save the city from the giant kitty!

(In Ninjago City, the citizens are evacuating as Meowthra continues to destroy everything.)

Citizen 1: This cat is destroying everything!

Citizen 2: Where are the ninjas when we need them?

Citizen 3: We have to evacuate!

Citizen 4: Run! Run!

Garmadon: Hey, Ninjago! Garmadon’s back! Generals! Stop anyone that gets in my way.

Angler fish General: Yes, sir.

Shark General: Whoa, it’s the Destiny’s Bounty! I’ve always wanted to shoot at it! Attack!

Intercom: Alpha team, on it!

Wu: We have company! Hold on tight!

(The Bounty loops around and flies under a bridge.)

Shark General: Hey, where’d they go?

Lloyd: Alright, ninjas! Follow me!

(The Ninja jump down and suit up.)

Ninja: Ninjaaa GO!

Lloyd: Nya, we need to get to Garmadon and that cat, fast!

Nya: You got it!

(Garmadon lands near Meowthra.)

Garmadon: Alright, you beast. Get ready to feel the wrath of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon.

(Some of Garmadon’s forces descend on the Ninja.)

Kai: Here they come!

Nya: Come on, let’s go!

Lloyd: Follow Nya!

(The Ninja jump off the bridge and land on Nya’s arms, who carries them across the water.
