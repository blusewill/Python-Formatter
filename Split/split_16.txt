The scene cuts to the Generals carrying Lloyd and Garmadon in a cage.)

Generals: ♪We got Garmado-on! And this random ki-id! We are going to kill them! Oops we shouldn’t have said that!♪

Garmadon: I command you to release me and my son! That's an order, Generals!

Bob: ♪I can't hear you!♪

Garmadon: I said I command you to release me and my son!

Shark General: Hey! The reason Bob can't hear is because his eardrums blew up after you shot him out of a volcano!

Bob: ♪I can't hear you!♪

Shark General: You stupid butt!

Garmadon: What?! (to Lloyd) Can you believe what they're saying? It's like I’m being treated worse than anyone in the history of the world. Well, good thing you never have to experience anything like this Luh-Lloyd.

Lloyd: Yeah. Yeah, no one ever says mean things to me when my dad knocks over their Pilates studio... or their waxing salon... or their kayak repair store! Or that place that sells toner cartridges! And you better believe no one ever makes fun of me for not knowing how to throw or catch a ball.

Garmadon: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, hold on. I-I know it's funny, but what kind of jerk would make fun of you for that?

Lloyd: You're kidding, right?

Garmadon: You gotta stand up for yourself and shoot them out of a volcano! That's how I roll! You got to get yourself a volcano, kid.

Lloyd: (sighs) Yeah. Blowing stuff up and never putting it back together. That is what you're best at... isn't it?

(Garmadon frowns, but doesn’t reply.)

Olivia: Well, hello! We have got a present for you!

Garmadon: Oh. An exact reproduction of my volcanic lair. And let me guess. You're going to fire us out of it.

Olivia: Oh, no! We're gonna fire you into the volcano. The fifteen million Kelvin magma will melt your skin before you can even feel the heat! Omar! Take them to the top!

Omar: Okie-dokie.

(Omar whistles and a hook attaches to the cage.)

Shark General: Up we go!

(Meanwhile, the other Ninja are lost in the jungle. Jay cries out as he pushes through the grass and falls on his face.)

Jay: Aahhh! What is that?!

Nya: Hey!

Jay: (suddenly acting cool) What's up?

Zane: Peow! Peow peow peow!

Nya: Zane! Are you okay?

Zane: I think I might be an adrenaline junkie.

(Kai runs out of the bushes, carrying Cole over his shoulder.)

Kai: I got you, dude! I got you!

Cole: I really could have walked out by myself, but thank you.

(Kai throws Cole onto the ground.)

Cole: Ow!

Nya: Wait! Where's Lloyd?

Jay: Um...

Kai: Uh...

Nya: Oh no... I can't believe we just ran off and left him back there.

Zane: This is terrible.

Jay: We are... horrible friends.

Zane: And sub-par ninjas too.

Kai: That's right. That's right.

Cole: Wait! Guys!

(The Ninja hear talking and run to see the volcano.)

Jay: Um...

Nya: Oh no!

Ninja: Lloyd!

Cole: He's in trouble.

Kai: Aw, man. What are we going to do?

Nya: We can still do this guys. We just got to figure out how to be real ninjas.

Jay: You know what would be really brave? Making camp, sleeping for the night, wake up in the day...

Kai: Yeah, that's brave.

Nya: Wait, Zane! Don't you have like seven hundred gigabytes of martial arts movies on your hard drive?

Zane: (beeping) Correct.

Nya: Great! Roll ‘em!

Narrator: Zane's Martial Arts Movie Club! The Deadly Groundskeeper! Cop Tale 3! The Iceman Puncheth! Furious Fire Fist! Wallpuncher! Good Girls vs Bad Guys! Killer Bills Volume 2! Board Game of Death! Spear Dancer! The Mainframe! Caffeinated Master! H-ip Man! Judo Future Boy! Locke 2: The Joy Locke Club! I Told You You're Wasting Your Time I Vowed To Give Up That Way Of Life! Look Who’s Punching! Look Who’s Punching Too!

Ninja: Whoa!

Zane: Ay-ay-ay.

Nya: I learned so many things so fast.

Kai: That's right. That's right.

Jay: I'm ready!

Cole: Time to get down and dirty. Ninja style.

Ninja: Alright!

(Nya goes underwater and shoots a jet of water upwards.)

Shark General: Whoa! Is that a whale?

(The General gets pulled underwater.)

Shark General: Whoa!

(Nya pulls another General underwater.)

Angler Fish General: Aah!

Crab General: Guys, no swimming.
