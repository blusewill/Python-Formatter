You want to hear it?

Wu: Oh yeah? What did he say?

Omar: (clears his throat) He says you're a big, stupid, dumb, dumb with a dumb face and a big butt and your butt stinks and you smell like a butt.

Wu: ...That sounds like my brother.

Omar: Get him!

(Wu fights off various Shark Army soldiers. In the city, the Ninja are in pursuit of Garmadon.)

Lloyd: Jay!

Jay: Yeah?

Lloyd: You take the air! Kai, Zane, Cole, downtown! Nya, water.

Nya: Got it!

Lloyd: I'm going after Garmadon.

Jay: Why don't I take your dad this time?

Lloyd: I got this. I’m totes profesh.

Kai: Wait, what does that mean?

Nya: I think he's trying to say he's a total professional?

Kai: Then why is he totes abbreving?

Zane: I'm pretty sure Lloyd’s nervous.

Lloyd: What?! That’s... crazy talk.

Zane: Incorrect.

Lloyd: Hey, I got this! Stand down, Garmadon!

Garmadon: Well, hello, Green Ninja!

Lloyd: It's time for you to Ninja-go away for good. Take this!

Computer: Mega missile mode. Left claw missile. Toenail missile. Wrist rocket. [?] Spine missile, one, two, three, four. Tongue rocket. Tail rocket, one, two. Eye missile. Other eye missile. Head missile. Other head missile. Backup head missile. Butt torpedoes.

(The weapons hit Garmadon again, but this time he is unharmed.)

Garmadon: Your weapons are powerless against my new mech.

Lloyd: What? Well, take this!

Computer: Releasing full payload.

Lloyd: Here it c-

(Garmadon’s mech grabs Lloyd’s dragon mech by the neck, stopping it in its tracks.)

Computer: Alert! Alert!

Garmadon: You having trouble with that dragon mech, Green Ninja? Buh-bye!

Lloyd: Wait!

(Garmadon tosses Lloyd’s mech far across the city, into the ocean.)

Lloyd: Noooo!

Cole: Jay, what's happening?

Jay: Garmadon has taken out Lloyd!

Kai: What?!

Nya: Wait, what?!

Cole: I'm sorry, what did you say?

Jay: Repeat: GARMADON’S TAKEN OUT LLOYD!

(Lloyd climbs out of the wreckage and looks toward the Destiny’s Bounty, suddenly getting an idea.)

Michael: It looks like the police, the army and the coast guard have all been rendered useless by Garmadon’s forces.

Cole: Guys, Garmadon’s almost at city hall!

Kai: Can one of you stop him?!

Nya: I’m swamped down here.

Jay: A little busy!

(Garmadon walks up the side of Ninjago Tower.)

Garmadon: Ha ha ha! Look at me go! Who wants a shark? You want a shark? You get a shark!

(Garmadon fires sharks into an office building, causing the workers to run for the elevators. They mash the buttons.)

Worker: Come on, come on, come on!

(The elevator opens to reveal more sharks inside. The worker runs away screaming. Inside Garmadon’s mech, he is getting tired.)

Garmadon: Oh! Ah! Just walking- to the top!

Kai: Uh, Lloyd would be really beneficial right now!

Jay: Aaargh! Where are you, Lloyd?

(Aboard the Bounty, Wu is still fighting off soldiers.)

Wu: I’m a ninja master! You are no match for me!

(Lloyd sneaks aboard while Wu is distracted.)

Wu: I came here to drink boba and kick butt. And I’m all out of boba.

(Lloyd finds the Ultimate Weapon. Meanwhile, Garmadon reaches the top of Ninjago Tower.)

Garmadon: Hey, Ninjagooo!

Michael: Oh, wait, that’s bad.

Robin: Garmadon is conquering Ninjago!

(Garmadon plants a flag and cheers triumphantly.)

Michael: Robin, this is a day that will live in infamy! I just made that up!

Robin: No, you didn’t.

Michael: Yes I did! Copyright Michael Strahan. That's mine now!

Garmadon: Woo! I’ve done it! I’m finally the ruler of Ninjago! Forever! And ever! (laughs)

(Lloyd appears behind him, wielding the Ultimate Weapon.)

Lloyd: Stand down, Garmadon!

Garmadon: Green Ninja? And... the legendary Ultimate Weapon?! Ugh, it's not fair.

Lloyd: I'm sick and tired of you trying to conquer Ninjago!

Garmadon: Alright, Green Ninja. Now, listen, just calm down... You don't have to use that thing.

Lloyd: So you're going to leave Ninjago?

Garmadon: Yeah!

Lloyd: Forever?

Garmadon: I promise.

Lloyd: What- what are you- why is your hand behind your back? What are you doing back there? Are you crossing your fingers?

Garmadon: That's...
